# SeleniumProject
Before running this project, you MUST download Selenium framework and import it to your project (In IntelliJ, you can go to File --> Project Structure --> Libraries and click on the + button for importing)
If you were familiar with Maven, you can replace "System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "src/main/resources/webdriver/chromedriver");" to use it
